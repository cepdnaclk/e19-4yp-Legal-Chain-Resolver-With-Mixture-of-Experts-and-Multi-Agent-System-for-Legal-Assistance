## Abstract
The Sri Lankan legal system faces significant barriers in accessibility, affordability, and efficiency, particularly within commercial law. High legal costs, language barriers, and limited digital legal resources make timely and accurate legal assistance challenging for many, especially SMEs. Existing AI-driven legal solutions in Sri Lanka predominantly rely on Natural Language Processing (NLP), which lacks structured legal reasoning and is prone to hallucinations. This project proposes an AI-driven legal assistance framework focused on Sri Lankan commercial law, integrating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, a multi-agent system, and knowledge graphs. The system is designed to enhance legal accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency by dynamically routing legal queries to domain-specific AI experts, structuring legal knowledge, and simulating real-world legal workflows. This approach aims to provide accessible, reliable, and context-aware legal support for businesses, legal professionals, and policymakers in Sri Lanka, ultimately improving legal decision-making and compliance
