Commercial law in Sri Lanka governs the legal principles that regulate business and commercial transactions within the country. Rooted in Roman-Dutch law and influenced by English common law, Sri Lankaâ€™s commercial legal system covers a wide range of areas including contracts, trade, banking, insurance, partnerships, and company law. The Sale of Goods Ordinance, the Companies Act No. 7 of 2007, and the Partnership Ordinance are key legislative instruments that guide business practices. These laws provide the framework for fair and transparent transactions, ensuring that the rights and obligations of all parties involved in commercial dealings are legally protected.

In recent years, Sri Lanka has made efforts to modernize its commercial legal landscape to align with international standards and encourage foreign investment. The establishment of specialized commercial courts, digital company registration services, and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms like arbitration have improved the efficiency of resolving business disputes. However, challenges such as delays in litigation and lack of awareness among small business owners still persist. Overall, commercial law in Sri Lanka plays a vital role in supporting economic development by creating a stable legal environment for commerce and entrepreneurship.
