RESEARCH PROBLEM    As specified by the S. 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance No. 5  of 1852, the main source of Commercial Law in Sri Lanka is  English Law.   SGO of 1896 of Sri Lanka is based on the  English Sale of Goods Act of 1893 drafted by Sir Mackenzie  Chalmers.

As correctly emphasized by jurists like Roscoe Pound,  law cannot remain static and it should evolve.  However,  the SGO of 1896, contrary to the SGA of 1979, still remains  static without any reforms even after a century and two  decades since its enactment.

Following problematic areas in the SGO of 1896 should be  addressed to be on a par with the commercial trends of the  21st Century.    A. Retention of the outmoded term, merchantable quality    With regard to conditions and warranties, S.15 (2) of the  SGO of 1896 specifies that where the goods are bought by  description from a seller who deals in goods of that  description (Whether he be the manufacturer or not), there  is an implied condition that the goods shall be of  merchantable quality", "label": "Chunk"}},

Further, S. 16 (2) (c) of the Act  specifies that there is an implied condition that the goods  shall be free from any defect rendering them merchantable,  which would not be apparent on a reasonable examination  of the sample. However, the Act does not provide a  definition of the phrase merchantable quality and  therefore creates ambiguity.     The phrase merchantable quality was included in the  SGA of 1979. In 1987, the UK Law Commission Report on  Sale and Supply of Goods suggested a revision of the  phrase stating that the phrase, merchantable quality  reflects the trade practices of the 19th century.  Later, it was  altered and the phrase satisfactory quality was  substituted in 1995 through", "label": "Chunk"}},

Currently, S. 14 (2) of the SGA of 1979 specifies that  where the seller sells goods in the course of a business,  there is an implied term that the goods supplied under the  contract are of satisfactory quality. The lead taken by the  English legislators have been followed by many states all  around the globe. For example, in Singapore, the phrase  merchantable quality included in the Singapore Sale of  Goods Act was substituted with the novel term,  satisfactory quality through an amendment made to the  Act in 1996.    However, the SGO of 1896 still retains the phrase  merchantable quality even though this expression appears  to be more appropriate for contracts between merchants  and less appropriate for contracts made in the context", "label": "Chunk"}},

In 1910, Farwell LJ, in Bristol Tramways v.  Fiat Motors Ltd (1910), observed that, merchantable  quality seems more appropriate to a retail purchaser  buying from a wholesale firm than to private buyers, and to  natural products, such as grain, wool, or flour, than to a  complicated machine.  Further, the phrase merchantable  quality does not enable minor defects of goods which do  not disturb the functionality of the goods to be considered  adequate to render the goods unmerchantable (Millars of  Falkirk Ltd v. Turpie 1976) and this diminishes the standard  of quality of the goods.     The SGO of 1896 neither provides a definition to the  phrase merchantable quality nor states how", "label": "Chunk"}},

Therefore, a Sri Lankan judge when  required to assess merchantable quality will have consider  terms of  the contract in question and make reference to a  myriad of English case law. In cases like Kearley & Tonge v.  Peter (1922), the merchantable quality of the goods was  assessed based on the evidence provided by a surveyor.  This kind of a subjective approach can produce unfairness  and result in inconsistent decisions since the Ordinance  fails to provide a clear test or guidelines to be referred by  the judges when assessing the  merchantable quality. On  the other hand the SGA of 1979, under S. 14 (2A) of the Act  has introduced an objective test to assess satisfactory  quality which specifies that ", "label": "Chunk"}},

Further,  S. 14 (2B) of the SGA of 1979 states that the quality of  goods includes their state and condition and the following  aspects, inter alia, which are to be considered as  aspects of  the quality of goods in suitable circumstances.    1.

Further, these factors elevate the overall  standard of the required quality.    Before the substitution of the term satisfactory quality,  English judges tended to define merchantable quality as  reasonably fit for the particular purpose for which it is  bought (Randall v. Newson 1877) and Sri Lankan judges  also interpreted the phrase deriving from this definition  (Assen Cutty V. Brooke Bond (1934). This definition  however, does not seem appropriate since the fitness for  purpose relates to sale of goods, ascertained or  unascertained, for a specific purpose whereas the  merchantable quality relates to sale of particular goods  not for specific use but for many possible uses", "label": "Chunk"}},

Further, it is  significant for the Ordinance to provide a clear test and a  set of guidelines for the purpose of reference by the judges  when assessing this quality.       B. Problematic requirement under S.14 for the goods to  comply with all parts of description.    S. 14 of the SGO of 1896 states that Where there  is a contract for the sale of goods by description, there  is an implied condition that the goods will correspond  with the description", "label": "Chunk"}},

The section further specifies  that, if the sale is by sample and description, the goods  should correspond with both the sample and the  description.    Since this requirement is a condition, breach of  the requirement under S. 14 will give rise to a right to  treat the contract as repudiated as per S. 12 (2) of the  Ordinance. Usually, if a seller fails to comply with a  condition, the buyer will have the right to completely  reject the goods and reject to pay the price, or, if he has  already paid for the goods, the right to recover the price.   The effect of this is that the statutory obligation  imposed by S. 14 should be strictly complied with by a  seller and the failure to do so, no matter how trivial,  unless microscopic, would justify the buyer in rejecting", "label": "Chunk"}},

This is also known  as the perfect tender rule under which the buyer may  reject the goods if they fail in any respect to conform to  the contract (Beatty and Samuelson, 2012). Hence, this  section can produce injustice. Undesirable results that  can be produced by a strict interpretation of a statutory  provision of this nature are clearly demonstrated by the  case, Re Moore & Co Ltd and Landauer & Co Ltd (1921).       In Re Moore (1921), the buyer agreed to purchase  3000 tins of Australian canned fruit packed in cases  containing 30 tins.  When the goods were delivered,  half of the cases only contained 24 tins even though,  the value and quantity of the delivered tins (300) was ", "label": "Chunk"}},

Even though the disconformity in this case is a minor  one, the Court of Appeal made a strict interpretation of  S. 13 and thereby held that the buyers have the right to  completely reject the whole consignment of the goods.      It is submitted that this kind of a highly technical strict  interpretation will not bring forward desirable results  and it will hinder the growth of business transactions.    Further, it is suggested that when referring to S. 14  judges should make distinction between the breach of  descriptive words which constitute a substantial  ingredient of the identity of the goods under the  contract and therefore can be reasonably considered as  a breach of a condition and the other terms", "label": "Chunk"}},

C. The conflict between S. 34(1) and S. 35    S. 34 of the SGA of 1979 addresses buyers right to  examine the goods. S. 34 (1) provides that where goods  are delivered to the buyer which he has not previously  examined, he is not deemed to have accepted them unless  and until he has had a reasonable opportunity of examining  them for the purpose of ascertaining whether they are in  conformity with the contract.

The second way of accepting the goods is in conflict with  S. 34 (1). It is possible and it is in fact a common practise for  a buyer to do an act which disagrees with the sellers  ownership before he get a reasonable opportunity to  examine the goods for the purpose specified by S. 34(1).

Even though, the same conflict existed between the  analogous provisions in the English Act, this was later  remedied by amendments. Currently the S. 35 (2) of the  SGA of 1979 provides that the acceptance of the goods by", "label": "Chunk"}},
        {"data": {"id": "Proceedings in law, 9th International Research Conference-KDU, Sri Lanka  2016    31    the buyer is conditional upon the buyer having had a  reasonable opportunity of ascertaining whether the goods  are in conformity with the contract, or in the case of a sale  by sample, of comparing the bulk with the sample. Further  the S. 35 (6) (b) of the Act provides that the buyer is not  deemed to have accepted the goods merely because the  goods are delivered to another under a sub-sale or other  disposition.  The SGO of 1896 however still hasnt remedies the  conflict between the two provisions and this kind of legal  ambiguity can lead to unwanted problems and thereby  undue delays.  Therefore, it is recommended that the SGO  of 1896 should remedy this unsatisfactory position by  clearly specifying the governing provision out of the two.       D.

It is important to  distinguish  between  two  different  categories  of  unascertained goods, namely the goods which are wholly  unascertained and the goods which are quasi-specific  (Goode and McKendrick, 2010).

S. 17 of the SGO of 1896 provides that where there is a  contract for unascertained goods, no property in the goods  is transferred to the buyer unless and until the goods are  ascertained.  By virtue of this provision, a buyer of  unascertained goods will have only contractual rights  against the seller and he will not hold any rights in goods.

Further, he  will be unable to claim the remedy of specific performance  under the S. 51 of the Ordinance since the S. 51 applies  only when the goods are specific or ascertained.

Therefore, the  buyer did not have a right to claim the goods and he had to  merely join the other general creditors.

In this context, it is  problematic whether the SGO of 1896, if remained  unamended, will hinder economic development. The  research aims to emphasize several areas in the Ordinance  which should undergo reforms to reflect the needs and the  changes of the current commercial world. Traditional black  letter approach and the legal research methodology are  employed to conduct this research. Qualitative data is  gathered through a review of primary sources; national and  foreign legislation, case law, and secondary sources; books  with critical analysis, law journals and conference papers.

Retention of the outmoded term, merchantable quality    With regard to conditions and warranties, S.15 (2) of the  SGO of 1896 specifies that where the goods are bought by  description from a seller who deals in goods of that  description (Whether he be the manufacturer or not), there  is an implied condition that the goods shall be of  merchantable quality", "relation": "SIMILAR"},

CONCLUSION    It is known fact that the SGO of 1896 is a well drafted  piece of legislation compared to most of the recently  enacted statutes. Even though the language in the statute  is readable and far simpler than most statutes, this  simplicity is somewhat deceptive. Any practitioner, a law  student or a layman when making reference to the SGO of  1896, without any doubt, would encounter problems  enhanced, inter alia, due to the ambiguous and undefined  terms encapsulated in the statute. Some provisions of the  Act fail to embrace the development of the modern trade  and hence the Act is commonly seen as a mercantile code  which reflects the 19th century trade. However, it is unfair  to expect the draftsmen in the 1896 to envisage the  changed nature of commercial transactions of todays  world.

The legal framework relating to the sale of  goods in Sri Lanka is provided by the Sale of Goods  Ordinance No 11 of 1896 (SGO of 1896) of Sri Lanka.

RESEARCH PROBLEM    As specified by the S. 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance No. 5  of 1852, the main source of Commercial Law in Sri Lanka is  English Law.   SGO of 1896 of Sri Lanka is based on the  English Sale of Goods Act of 1893 drafted by Sir Mackenzie  Chalmers. Even though, the English Act of 1893 was a well-  drafted piece of legislation, later it was repealed.
