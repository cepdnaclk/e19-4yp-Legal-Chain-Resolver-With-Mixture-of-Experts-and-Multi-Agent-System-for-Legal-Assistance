    "    \"\"\"• Shareholder's Right to Inspect Records: A shareholder is entitled to inspect documents listed in section 119 of the Companies Act. These documents include minutes of all meetings and resolutions of shareholders, copies of written communications to all shareholders, including annual reports, financial statements, and group financial statements, for the preceding ten years. They also have the right to inspect certificates issued by directors under the Act and the company's interests register. The inspection must be available at the place where the company's records are kept, specifically between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. on each working day during the \"inspection period\". The \"inspection period\" commences on the third working day after notice of intention to inspect is served on the company and ends on the eighth working day after the day of service.\n",
    "• Shareholder's Right to Copies: A person may require a copy of or extract from a document made available for inspection under sections 119 or 120. The company must send this copy or extract within five working days after a written request and payment of a reasonable copying and administration fee as determined by the company. If the company fails to provide a copy or extract as requested, the company shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine not exceeding one hundred thousand rupees, and every officer in default shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine not exceeding fifty thousand rupees.\n",
    "• Shareholder's Right to Articles: A shareholder has a right at any time to request a company in writing for a copy of its articles. The company must comply with such request within five working days of the date of receipt. However, the company may require the shareholder to pay a fee of not more than five hundred rupees before providing a copy. Alternatively, the company can decline to provide a copy if a copy has already been provided to that shareholder within the previous six months.\"\"\",\n",

    "    \"\"\"• Failure to maintain proper documents: A person who fails to maintain proper documents as required by the Act shall be liable for a penalty for each month or part of a month during which the failure continues. The penalty shall be one thousand rupees per day for each day the failure continues. However, before assessing this penalty, the Commissioner-General must issue a warning notice, and no penalty shall be due if the taxpayer complies with the warning notice within the specified time.\n",
    "• Failure to submit required documents (general): A penalty of a sum not exceeding two hundred and fifty thousand rupees may be imposed where required documents have not been submitted.\n",
    "• Non-disclosure of required information (transfer pricing): In the case of non-disclosure of any required information related to transactions with associated enterprises, a penalty of a sum not exceeding two per centum of the aggregate value of those transactions may be imposed.\n",

    "    \"\"\"• Application Requirements: An application for a license must be made in writing to the Monetary Board in the prescribed manner and accompanied by an application fee. For a company to be formed for the purpose of carrying on banking business, the application must be accompanied by:\n",
    "    ◦ A copy of the Articles of Association or the Constitution or any other document associated with the formation of such company, together with any proposed amendments.\n",

The Director of Bank Supervision may further require the applicant to furnish other documents, information, or particulars deemed necessary to determine whether a license should be issued.\n",
    "• Monetary Board Evaluation Criteria: Upon receipt of an application, the Monetary Board may conduct investigations to satisfy itself as to the suitability of the company or proposed company for a license, having regard to the interests of the national economy, including the banking needs of Sri Lanka. The Monetary Board may specifically require the applicant to satisfy the Board on:\n",

    "    ◦ The applicant's compliance with the provisions of the Act or any directions given under the Act in relation to the application.\n",
    "• It is an offence under the Act to submit information or particulars in an application or related documents that are, to the person's knowledge, false or misleading in any material particular.\"\"\",\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Answer 4\n",
    "    \"\"\"• Public Offer Approval: A listed public company or any public company that has applied to obtain a listing in an exchange shall not make a public offer of securities either directly or through a third party (by way of a prospectus or similar document or otherwise for solicitation of funds from the public) unless approved by the Commission or a person authorized by the Commission. The Commission may also require approval for certain public offers of unlisted companies, considering factors like volume, class, number/type of investors, nature of issuer, or market.\n",
    "• Prospectus Content and Dating: A prospectus issued by or on behalf of a company, or in relation to a company to be formed, must bear a date, which is presumed to be the date of publication unless proven otherwise. It must contain the information specified in Part I of the Fourth Schedule and set out the reports specified in Part II of that Schedule. Any condition requiring an applicant to waive compliance with these requirements or purporting to affect them with notice of unreferenced contracts is void. It is unlawful to issue an application form for shares or debentures unless it is issued with a prospectus that complies with these requirements.\n",
    "• Registration of Prospectus: A prospectus cannot be issued unless a copy has been delivered to the Registrar for registration. This copy must be endorsed on or attached with required documents, such as a declaration by every named director (or proposed director) that they have read the Act's provisions and that they have been complied with. If a prospectus is issued without a copy being delivered or without the required documents attached, the company and any knowing party to the issue shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine not exceeding two hundred thousand rupees.\n",
    "• Civil Liability for Untrue Statements: Where a prospectus invites persons to subscribe for shares or debentures, the following persons are liable to pay compensation to subscribers for any loss or damage sustained by reason of any untrue statement included in such prospectus:\n",
    "    ◦ Every person who is a director of the company at the time of issue.\n",
    "    ◦ Every person who has authorised himself to be named and is named in the prospectus as a director or as having agreed to become a director.\n",
    "    ◦ Every promoter of the company.\n",
    "    ◦ Every person who has authorised the issue of the prospectus.\n",
    "• An \"untrue statement\" is defined as a statement that is misleading in the form and context in which it is included. A statement is deemed included if it is contained in or in any report or memorandum appearing on the face of, or by reference incorporated in, or issued with, the prospectus.\n",
    "• Defenses against Liability: A director or other person responsible for the issue of a prospectus will not incur liability for non-compliance or contravention if they prove they were not cognizant of the undisclosed matter, or that it arose from an honest mistake of fact. Specific defenses exist for untrue statements by experts or from public official documents if the person had reasonable ground to believe and did believe the statement was true/fairly represented. A person liable for an expert's statement can avoid liability if they withdrew their written consent before delivery of a copy of the prospectus for registration. A person having given consent as an expert is not deemed to have authorised the issue of the prospectus for purposes of general liability, except for statements purporting to be made by them as an expert.\n",
    "• Right to Contribution: Every person liable to make payment under this section may recover contribution from any other person who would have been separately liable for the same payment, unless the person seeking contribution was guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation and the other person was not.\"\"\",\n",

    "     # Answer 5\n",
    "    \"\"\"• The Intellectual Property Act includes provisions for \"fair use\" that do not constitute copyright infringement.\n",
    "• Reproduction for Teaching Purposes: The Act permits, without the authorization of the copyright owner, the reproduction of a short part of a published work for teaching purposes by way of illustration, in writing or sound or visual recordings. This is allowed provided that the reproduction is compatible with fair practice and does not exceed the extent justified by the purpose of such reproduction.\n",
    "• Reprographic Reproduction for Face-to-Face Teaching: Also permitted is the reprographic reproduction for face-to-face teaching in any educational institution whose activities do not serve direct or indirect commercial gain, of published articles, other short works or short extracts of works. This is allowed to the extent justified by the purpose, provided that the act of reproduction is an isolated one occurring, if repeated, on separate and unrelated occasions. In both these cases of reproduction, the source of the work reproduced and the name of the author must be indicated as far as practicable on all copies made.\n",
    "• Performance or Display for Educational Purposes: The performance or display of a work for educational or teaching purposes by government or non-profit educational institutions, in classrooms or similar places set aside for education, is explicitly stated as not being an infringement of copyright. For an audiovisual work, this is subject to the condition that the performance or the display of individual images is given by means of a lawfully made copy, or the person responsible for the performance did not know or had no reason to believe that the copy was not lawfully made.\n",
    "Based on these provisions, \"Knowledge Hub's\" actions, assuming they comply with the specified conditions, would generally not constitute copyright infringement.\"\"\",\n",

    "    \"\"\"• Default of a Party: An arbitral tribunal may, notwithstanding the failure of a party without reasonable cause, to appear before it, or to comply with any order made by it, continue the arbitral proceedings and determine the dispute on the material available to it.\n",
    "• Powers Regarding Evidence and Documents: Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral tribunal has broad powers to conduct the proceedings. These include the power to:\n",
    "    ◦ Order the discovery and production of documents or materials within the possession or power of a party.\n",
    "    ◦ Order the answering of interrogatories.\n",
    "    ◦ Order any party to do all such other things during the arbitral proceedings as may reasonably be needed to enable an award to be made properly and efficiently.\n",
    "• The arbitral tribunal also determines the admissibility, relevance, materiality, and weight of any evidence. All statements, documents, or other information supplied to the arbitral tribunal by one party must be communicated to the other party. Parties must be given sufficient advance notice of any hearing and of any meeting of the arbitral tribunal for the purposes of inspection of goods, other property, or documents.\"\"\",\n",

    "    # Answer 7\n",
    "    \"\"\"• Duty to Act in Good Faith and Company's Interests: Mr. Chan, as a director, has a fundamental duty to act in good faith and in the interests of the company.\n",
    "• Standard of Care: Directors are required to exercise the degree of skill and care that may reasonably be expected of a person of his knowledge and experience.\n",
    "• Use of Company Information (Prohibition): A director or employee of a company must not use information acquired by virtue of their position for their personal gain or for the gain of any other person, or to the detriment of the company. This prohibition also extends to information acquired as a former director or employee.\n",
    "• Exceptions for Information Use/Disclosure: A director may disclose, make use of, or act on information only if:\n",
    "    ◦ It is required by law.\n",
    "    ◦ The director is first authorized to do so by the board, and particulars of the authorization are entered in the interests register. The board can grant such authorization if it is satisfied that doing so will not be likely to prejudice the company.\n",
    "    ◦ The company’s articles authorize the director to do so.\n",
    "• Reliance on Reports and Advice: A director of a company may rely on reports, statements, and financial data and other information prepared or supplied, and on professional or expert advice given by:\n",
    "    ◦ An employee of the company.\n",
    "    ◦ A professional adviser or expert in relation to matters within their professional or expert competence.\n",
    "    ◦ Any other director or committee of directors (in which the relying director did not serve) in relation to matters within their designated authority.\n",
    "• However, this reliance is permissible only if the director:\n",
    "    ◦ Acts in good faith.\n",
    "    ◦ Makes proper inquiry where the need for inquiry is indicated by the circumstances.\n",
    "    ◦ Has no knowledge that such reliance is unwarranted.\"\"\",\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Answer 8\n",
    "    \"\"\"• General Insider Trading Prohibition: An \"insider\" is defined as a person who possesses information that is not generally available, and they know (or could reasonably be expected to know) that if this information became generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of securities. Such an insider is prohibited from selling, buying, or entering into agreements for the sale or purchase of such securities, or procuring their acquisition or disposal. They are also prohibited from communicating this information to another person if they know (or could reasonably be expected to know) that the other person would acquire or dispose of those securities.\n",
    "• Exception for Underwriting Agreements: The Act provides a specific exception where the general insider trading prohibitions shall not apply to the communication of information in relation to securities to a person solely for the purpose of procuring the person to enter into an underwriting agreement or a sub-underwriting agreement in relation to such securities. Furthermore, the general prohibition also does not apply where a person acquires such securities under an obligation to do so in an agreement referred to in paragraph (a) (i.e., an underwriting agreement).\n",
    "    ◦ Therefore, Ms. Davies' action of acquiring \"Beta Ltd.\" securities as part of her obligation under the underwriting agreement is likely exempt from the insider trading prohibitions.\n",
    "• Application to \"Alpha Corp.\" Recommendation: The scenario states that Ms. Davies makes a recommendation to a client about \"Alpha Corp.\" based on publicly available information, despite having access to non-public, price-sensitive information. If her recommendation was indeed solely based on publicly available information and she did not use or communicate the non-public, price-sensitive information she possessed about \"Alpha Corp.\" to her client, then her actions might not constitute insider trading. The critical factor is whether Ms. Davies actually used or communicated the inside information. If she only used public information, it would generally not be considered insider trading.\"\"\",\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Answer 9\n",
    "    \"\"\"• Court's Power to Summon and Examine: The court, before adjudication, may summon any person whom it believes capable of giving information concerning any act of insolvency committed by the person whose estate is subject to sequestration. The court may also examine any such person upon oath by word of mouth or interrogatories in writing concerning the act of insolvency. Furthermore, at any sitting of the court, the court may examine or permit the examination by creditors of every such person upon oath concerning the insolvent's person, trade, dealings, or estate, or any act of insolvency committed by the insolvent. The answers given must be reduced to writing and signed by the person examined.\n",
    "• Court's Power to Compel Document Production: The court may require any person so summoned to produce any books, papers, deeds, writings, and other documents in their custody, possession, or power which may appear necessary to establish an act of insolvency.\n",
    "• Consequences of Non-Compliance: If any person refuses to be sworn, or refuses to answer any lawful question put by the court, or does not fully answer any such question to the satisfaction of the court, or refuses to sign his examination when reduced into writing (unless having a lawful objection allowed by the court), or does not produce any required books, papers, deeds, writings, or other documents in their custody or power, it shall be lawful for the court, by warrant, to commit such person to prison. They are to remain in prison without bail until they submit to be sworn, fully answer to the court's satisfaction, sign the examination, and produce the documents. The court's warrant of commitment must specify every such question the person refused to answer or did not fully answer.\"\"\",\n",

    "    # Answer 10\n",
    "    \"\"\"• Assessment of \"Merchantable Quality\" under SGO 1896: Under section 15(2) of the Sale of Goods Ordinance (SGO) of 1896, where goods are bought by description from a seller who deals in goods of that description, there is an implied condition that the goods shall be of \"merchantable quality\". The sources indicate that under this Ordinance, \"merchantable quality\" is assessed based on evidence provided by a surveyor. This approach is characterized as a subjective approach that \"can produce unfairness and result in inconsistent decisions\".\n",
    "• Key Limitation/Problematic Area: The significant limitation with the term \"merchantable quality\" in the SGO of 1896 is that the Ordinance fails to provide a clear test or guidelines for judges when assessing the ‘merchantable quality’. This contrasts with the Sale of Goods Act (SGA) of 1979 (UK), which introduced an objective test for \"satisfactory quality\". The SGA 1979 specifies that goods are of satisfactory quality if they meet the standard that a reasonable person would regard as satisfactory, considering factors like description, price, and other relevant circumstances. The SGO 1896's lack of such an objective test leads to \"legal ambiguity\" and can cause \"unwanted problems and thereby undue delays\". It is recommended that the SGO be amended to rectify this conflict.\"\"\"\n",

These rights exist to ensure transparency and accountability from the company to its owners.\n",
    "• Inspection Rights:\n",
    "  The shareholder can inspect the register of members (share register) at the company’s registered office during reasonable business hours. The company may require inspection only at the registered office and during usual working hours; this is lawful, provided the hours are reasonable and do not unduly restrict access.\n",
    "  The shareholder also has the right to inspect minutes of shareholder meetings to understand decisions affecting the company.\n",
    "  Additionally, the company is obligated to keep and make available financial statements for at least the last five accounting periods, which the shareholder can access.\n",
    "• Obtaining Copies:\n",
    "  The shareholder can request copies of the Articles of Association, which govern the company’s constitution. The company can charge a fee for copying, but this fee must be reasonable—reflecting actual administrative or printing costs, and not an excessive or punitive charge.\n",
    "• If the Company Imposes Restrictions or Excessive Fees:\n",
    "  If the company restricts inspection unreasonably—such as allowing only very limited hours or imposing high fees—this may violate the shareholder’s statutory rights. The shareholder can apply to the courts for an order compelling the company to comply with the law and provide access on fair terms.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Regulations Regarding Public Offers and Prospectus Issuance:\n",
    "When making a public offer of securities, \"Future Growth Corp.\" must ensure that a prospectus or a similar document is issued. The approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) is required for the issue of securities. The Commission also has the power to issue stop orders related to securities offerings. A prospectus must be dated, and its registration is necessary. Furthermore, if a statement by an expert, bank, attorney-at-law, or auditor is included in the prospectus, their consent is required for the inclusion of their name.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Prospectus Content Requirements:\n",
    "The prospectus must contain specific particulars to ensure transparency and inform potential investors. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The business activities the subscribers or promoters intend for the company to carry out during the five years following the commencement of business.\n",
    "    Details regarding any founders', management, or deferred shares, including their number, nature, and the extent of the holders' interest in the company's property and profits.\n",

    "    When shares are offered to the public for subscription, the prospectus must specify the minimum amount that, in the directors' opinion, must be raised by the issue of share capital to provide for the necessary particulars.\n",
    "    The prospectus must report on dividends paid on each class of shares over the five financial years immediately preceding its issue. If no dividends were paid on any class of shares in any of those years, that fact must be stated. If no accounts have been prepared for any part of the five-year period ending three months before the prospectus issue, this must also be stated.\n",
    "    For companies without subsidiaries, the report within the prospectus must cover the profits or losses of the company for each of the five financial years immediately preceding the issue of the prospectus, and deal with the company's assets and liabilities as at the last balance sheet date.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Civil Liability for Untrue Statements in a Prospectus:\n",
    "An untrue statement in a prospectus can lead to civil liability. A statement is considered \"untrue\" if it is misleading in the form and context in which it is included. A statement is deemed included in a prospectus if it is contained in, incorporated by reference in, or issued with the prospectus, or in any report or memorandum appearing on its face.\n",

    "\"\"\" Under the Intellectual Property Act, No. 36 of 2003, the actions of \"Knowledge Hub,\" as a private, profit-earning educational institution, would likely constitute copyright infringement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Making multiple copies of a short part of a published textbook for classroom use without authorization:\n",
    "        The Intellectual Property Act generally grants the copyright owner the exclusive right to reproduce their work.\n",
    "        While Section 13(4)(b) provides an exception for reprographic reproduction of short parts of published works for face-to-face teaching, this exception specifically applies only to \"any educational institution the activities of which do not serve direct or indirect commercial gain.\"\n",
    "        Since \"Knowledge Hub\" is described as a \"private profit earning organization,\" it does not fall under this exception. Therefore, their reproduction of multiple copies without authorization would infringe on the copyright owner's exclusive right to reproduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Displaying an audiovisual work for teaching purposes in a classroom, using a lawfully made copy:\n",
    "        The Act also grants the copyright owner the exclusive right to publicly display their work.\n",
    "        Section 10(10)(a) states that the performance or display of a work for educational or teaching purposes is not an infringement if done \"by government or non profit educational institutions, in classrooms or similar places set aside for education.\" This section further stipulates that in the case of an audiovisual work, the display must be from a lawfully made copy, or the person responsible must not have known or had reason to believe the copy was not lawfully made.\n",
    "        Despite using a lawfully made copy, \"Knowledge Hub\" is a \"private profit earning organization,\" meaning it does not qualify as a \"government or non profit educational institution.\" Consequently, the exception for performance or display for educational purposes does not apply to \"Knowledge Hub.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the key factor determining infringement in both scenarios is \"Knowledge Hub's\" status as a profit-earning institution, which disqualifies it from the specific exceptions granted to non-profit or government educational institutions under the Intellectual Property Act.\n",
    "\n",

These summons can require a person to attend for examination before the tribunal and to produce any specified documents or things.

    "Directors' Standard of Care: Mr. Chan, in his capacity as a director, must not act in a manner that is reckless or grossly negligent. He is expected to exercise the degree of skill and care that can reasonably be expected from a person with his knowledge and experience. His heavy reliance on an employee's report without much scrutiny suggests a potential failure to meet this standard of care, as it implies a lack of proper inquiry.\n",

    "Use of Company Information: Mr. Chan has learned sensitive information about a potential major transaction in his capacity as a director, which would not otherwise be available to him. He is strictly prohibited from disclosing this information to any person or from using or acting on it for personal benefit, such as for a personal investment. The only exceptions are if the use is for the purposes of the company, as required by law, or if the board explicitly authorizes him to do so and the authorization particulars are recorded. Such board authorization can only be given if it is satisfied that the disclosure or use will not prejudice the company. Therefore, his consideration of using this information for personal investment is a direct violation of his duty.\n",

    "\"\"\" Under the Sale of Goods Ordinance of 1896, \"merchantable quality\" is an implied condition in contracts where goods are bought by description from a seller who deals in such goods. It also implies that goods should be free from defects rendering them unmerchantable that would not be apparent upon a reasonable examination of a sample. However, the Ordinance itself does not provide a definition for \"merchantable quality\" nor does it outline a specific method for its assessment. Consequently, a judge in Sri Lanka would typically need to assess this quality by considering the terms of the specific contract. This subjective approach can lead to ambiguity and inconsistent decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key limitation or problematic area with the term \"merchantable quality\" compared to more modern legislation is its outdated nature and lack of clear objective criteria. The term originated from 19th-century trade practices and is deemed more suitable for transactions between merchants than for contemporary consumer sales, especially for complex products like electronic devices. Historically, courts have noted that this term is less appropriate for \"complicated machines\" and \"private buyers.\" A significant issue is that \"merchantable quality\" often does not consider minor defects that do not completely impede the goods' primary functionality as sufficient to render them unmerchantable, thereby lowering the expected quality standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, modern legislation, such as the UK Sale of Goods Act of 1979 (amended in 1995), replaced \"merchantable quality\" with the more consumer-focused term \"satisfactory quality.\" This modern approach introduces an objective test, defining \"satisfactory quality\" as the standard a \"reasonable person would regard as satisfactory, taking account of any description of the goods, the price (if relevant) and all the other relevant circumstances.\" This provides a clearer, more consistent framework for assessing product quality in consumer transactions.\n",
