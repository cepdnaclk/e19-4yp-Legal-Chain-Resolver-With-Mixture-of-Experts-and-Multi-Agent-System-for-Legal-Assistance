For example, a contract to sell illegal goods would be void.Capable Terms: The terms of the contract must be clear, specific, and capable of being performed.These principles align with South African common law, statutes like the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008, and international frameworks such as the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts (2016).\",\n",
